# GithubApiApp

Description
GitHub API App created using Angular Framework and covers following usecases

* Search: When a user enters a username, it should be able to get a full list of public gists by that user.
* Filetype: Convert the filetypes of the files in the gist into a tag/badge, (e.g, if the returned gist has list of files containing python and javascript files, the gist should have the respective tags/badges).
